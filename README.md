# Prescribed Drug Abuse System
- This Project identifies the individuals who are addicted to the prescribed drugs. 
- Also identifies Pharmacies who sell off drugs in quantities more than what is prescribed and tags them as 'Bad Pharmacies' in order that individuals using this system are aware about the Good and Bad Pharmacies
